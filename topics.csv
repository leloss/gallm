An ext ISAM indexed sequential file consists of records of size 64 bytes each including key field of size 14 bytes An address of a disk block takes 2 bytes If the disk block size is 512 bytes and there are 16 K records compute the size of the data and index areas in terms of number blocks How many levels of ext tree do you have for the index ,Indexing
Consider a file of 16384 records Each record is 32 bytes long and its key field is of size 6 bytes The file is ordered on a non key field and the file organization is unspanned The file is stored in a file system with block size 1024 bytes and the size of a block pointer is 10 bytes If the secondary index is built on the key field of the  file and a multi level index scheme is used to store the secondary index the  number  of  first level  and second level  blocks  in  the  multi level  index  are respectively 8 and 0 128 and 6 256 and 4 512 and 5 ,Indexing
